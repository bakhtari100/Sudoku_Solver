# Sudoku Solver

This project implements a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm in Python. 
The solver takes a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle as input, where empty cells are represented by `-1`, and attempts to solve it by filling in valid numbers.

## Features
1. Finds the next empty cell in the puzzle.
2. Validates guesses based on Sudoku rules (rows, columns, and 3x3 grids).
3. Uses backtracking to recursively solve the puzzle.
